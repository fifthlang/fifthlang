A .NET systems programming language with native support for knowledge graphs and semantic web technologies.  
Fifth is still under active development, and is not yet ready for mission-critical use.  
I invite you to get involved and play with it, and tell me what you do and don't love.

## Language Features

Fifth uniquely combines imperative programming with first-class RDF and SPARQL support.  Mostly, it's a lot like C#, but it takes the syntax for Function overloading, Destructuring, and nested Guard Clauses from languages like Erlang.  For a tour of the language, take a look at the [Learn X=5th in Y Minutes Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aabs/fifthlang/refs/heads/master/docs/Getting-Started/learn5thInYMinutes.md).  

### Basic Language Features
- Classes with methods and properties
- Function overloading with parameter constraints (guards)
- Parameter Destructuring with guard clauses
- All of the usual control-constructs
- Exception handling: try/catch/finally blocks
- Multiple module support with namespaces
- Namespace imports with aliasing support
- Type system: Primitives, classes, lists, Arrays
- List comprehensions with filtering

### Knowledge Graph Primitives
- Native RDF types: `graph`, `triple`, `store`, `query` are built-in language primitives
- Built-in KG runtime: `Fifth.System.KG` provides graph creation, triple management, and store operations
- Triple literals: `<subject, predicate, object>` syntax for inline RDF construction
- TriG blocks: Multi-line graph literals with full TriG syntax support
- SPARQL literals: Embed SPARQL queries directly in source code with `?<SELECT...>`
- Operator syntax provides clean and intuitive ways to work with triples, graphs, triple-stores and queries.
- Transparent persistence: Save graphs to remote stores with simple assignment: `myStore += graph;`

### What Works
- Full .NET IL compilation pipeline (via Roslyn back-end)
- Multi-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- MSBuild integration with `.5thproj` project files (very basic at this stage)
- Parameter destructuring in functions
- Classes with methods and properties
- Control flow statements (if/else, while)
- Exception handling with try/catch/finally
- Function overloading with parameter guards
- List comprehensions
- Knowledge graph operations (TriG literals, SPARQL literals, graph operations)
- Comprehensive test suite (TUnit + FluentAssertions)

### Planned Improvements
See our [architectural roadmap](Planning/architecture-review/NEXT-STEPS.md) for detailed plans. Key priorities:

- Published MSBuild SDK and compiler support via Nuget
- Direct Consumption of Query Results in List Comprehensions
- Architectural Improvements to support modern compiler tool chains: auto-complete, LSP, go to definition &c
- Parser error recovery: Better handling of syntax errors for IDE support
- Incremental compilation: Faster rebuild times for large projects

## Installation

Fifth provides pre-built, self-contained binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows — no additional .NET runtime required.

**[→ Full Installation Guide](Getting-Started/installation.md)**

Quick download:
1. Get the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aabs/fifthlang/releases)
2. Verify the checksum against `SHA256SUMS`
3. Extract and add `bin/` to your PATH

Or build from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aabs/fifthlang.git
cd fifthlang
dotnet build fifthlang.sln
```

---

## Quick Start

### Your First Fifth Program

Create a file `hello.5th`:

```fifth
main(): int {
    x: int = 42;
    return x;
}
```

Build and run with a `.5thproj` file (see below for project setup).

### Working with Knowledge Graphs

Create a file `kg-example.5th`:

```fifth
// Connect to a SPARQL store
alias x as <http://example.com/blah#>;
alias rdf as <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>;
myStore : store = sparql_store(<http://localhost:8080/graphdb>);

main(): int {

    // Create a graph and add triples
    g: graph = @< >;
    g += <x:Alice, x:age, 42>;
    g += <x:Alice, rdf:type, x:Person>;
    
    // Save to the store
    myStore += g;
    
    // SPARQL Literals embedded in 5th code...
    age: int = 42;
    rq: query = ?<
        PREFIX x: <http://example.com/blah#>
        SELECT ?person
        WHERE {
            ?person x:age age .
        }
    >;
    
    fortyTwoYearOlds: result = rq <- myStore ; // query application on a store
    
    // go do something with the results

    return 0;
}
```

## Creating Fifth Projects

Fifth integrates with .NET's build system using `.5thproj` files:

```xml
<!-- MyApp.5thproj -->
<Project Sdk="Fifth.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Build like any .NET project:

```bash
dotnet build MyApp.5thproj
dotnet run --project MyApp.5thproj
```

See [Fifth.Sdk documentation](Designs/fifth-sdk-readme.md) for more details.
